### About Prego!

Prego! is a quick reference guide compiling numerous tools to manipulate, analyze, visualize and read data.

It is meant to be a simple, easy website where people come to look for resources and tools to create data journalism-related or other kind of projects.

### What does Prego! mean?

Interjection
*from Italian*

1. Please! / You're welcome! / Not at all! / Don't mention it!
2. A much more warm and emotional "OK" in Italian
3. A multipurpose solution to every language need. Just what does it mean? Well, everything, actually

>  Prego implies serviceable attention, it commands respect, and it encourages people to either wake up or speak up.

### Find a tool

In prego you can browse around to find the tools you want to work with for data journalism and other data-related projects. We add the tools we get to know from basically every field, from javascript libraries for graphics to publishing templates and cool APIs.

This work is mostly a compilation list, so there is no attribution required whatsoever and we do not own any copyrights on any tools here, we just link to the source.

The advantage is that you can always come to the same place to find new and awesome things, no more need to google random words for the tool you are looking for. Enjoy!

Prego! is not the only site that does this kind of compilation. Check out our evil competition: [Mother Jones Toolbox](https://github.com/motherjones/story-tools), [Les Temps Toolbox](https://labs.letemps.ch/toolbox/), [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/), [Datavisualization.ch](http://selection.datavisualization.ch/), [graphics Catalogue](http://www.graphicscatalogue.com/), [Creative Bloq](http://www.creativebloq.com/design-tools/data-visualization-712402).

But we do have over 100 tools in an easily searchable list, and promise to keep updating.

### Credits
